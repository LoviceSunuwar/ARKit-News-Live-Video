The "MagicNewsPaper" application utilizes ARKit, a framework for augmented reality on iOS devices, to scan and detect specific images. When these images are recognized, the app plays a corresponding video on top of the detected image, creating an augmented reality experience. The app is aptly named "MagicNewsPaper" to evoke the idea of bringing static images to life with interactive video content. It combines the power of AR and video playback to enhance the user's interaction with printed images, creating a dynamic and engaging experience.
